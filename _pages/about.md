Welcome to my website!
I am Yuanlong Xiao, a Ph.D candidate in Electrical and System Engineering at the 
University of Pennsylvania. I am doing my research under Prof. [Andr√© DeHon](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/people.html). 

Research Interest
======
Currently, I mainly focused on accelerating FPGA compile time by overlay techniquues,
like partial reconfiguration, Network-on-a-Chip overlay, RISC-V and High-Level Sythesis. 

Past Research
======
I got my master degree in State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University.
During that 3 years, I mainly focused on FPGA silicon layout design. 

#How to edit your site's GitHub repository
#------
#Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
