Welcome to my website!
I am Yuanlong Xiao, a Ph.D candidate in Electrical and System Engineering at the 
University of Pennsylvania. I am doing my research under Prof. [Andr√© DeHon](http://ic.ese.upenn.edu/people.html). 

Research Interest
======
Currently, I mainly focus on accelerating FPGA compile time by partial reconfiguration, 
Network-on-a-Chip overlay, RISC-V and High-Level sythesis. 

Past Research
======
I received my master degree in Microelectronics from State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/),
where I mainly focused on FPGA silicon layout design. I received my 
Bachelor degree in Microelectronics from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm).
